# Compute factorial of positive integer using only built-ins

## Command:
```
$Â bang() ( eval let N=1 N*={1..$1} ; echo $N; )
```

## Explanation:
Explanation
Using let, this takes advantage of its mathematical functions and argument-based variable assignments to serially overwrite the last known value of N with the product of N and the next integer generated by the expansion of {1..$1} into a list of incremental numbers.  However, the order in which things are expanded and substituted means that {1..$1} would fail to expand into a list without using the eval command.  It provides a layer of globbing that, once the shell has substituted in the value of the parameter $1, will allow the braces to expand.
Thus the  expression passed to eval is  equivalent to:
let N=1 N=N*1 N=N*2 N=N*3 ... N=N*$1

## Limitations:
Limitations
If a positive integer is not the one and only argument passed to it when invoked by the user, the result will be nonsense or an error will be thrown.
