## Explanation:
Explanation
*Requires PV (pipe viewer) if you want to monitor throughput; otherwise you can leave out the pv pipe.
Transparently decompresses an arbitrary .gz file (does not have to be a tar) and re-compresses it to bzip2, which has better compression and error recovery.  Echoes error messages to a file named logfile.txt in your home directory.
NOTE: The original .gz file will NOT be deleted.  If you want to save space, you will have to delete it manually.
