## Command:
```

```

## Explanation:
Explanation
If you want to concat multiple files, you might end up with cat {a,b,c} >> yourcert.pem  in a loop. But the problem is that it doesnt create new line after each cat.
This script is for that matter.
To use, e.g.:
cd /etc/ssl/certs
files=("yourcert.crt" "provider.ca.pem") && for i in ${files[@]} ; do $(cat $i >> yourcert.pem && echo "" >> yourcert.pem) ; done

## Limitations:
Limitations
A fully complete script would:

Check if $GITFOLDER exists
Check if $GITFOLDER has a .git directory
Create a temporary (e.g. tmp=$(mktemp)) file to log anything; if [ "$?" -ne 0 ] ; exit with status exit 1, otherwise delete the $tmp file and exit 0.
