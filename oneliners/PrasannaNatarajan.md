## Command:

$Â mkcd(){ NAME=$1; mkdir -p "$NAME"; cd "$NAME"; }
```

## Explanation:
Explanation
Paste this function in the ~/.bashrc file.
Usage:
mkcd name1

This command will make a new folder called name1 and cd into the name1.
I find myself constantly using mkdir and going into the folder as the next step. It made sense for me to combine these steps into a single command.
